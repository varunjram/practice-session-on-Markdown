## **[ ] explore readlineSync**

There are different kinds of input which you can take using this library. Check them out. Use it in your apps. You can ask for simple YES/NO or do multi option like Kaun Banega Crorepati.

what I want you to learn here? Honestly, I am trying to instill good habits early on, two habits:

1. **Exploring documentation** is really important and the early  ou learn this the more you are set up for success in life.
2. **User friendly apps** are the best. And the way to make CLI apps user friendly is by making user type less number of keys. Use the docs to do that.

## **[ ] use chalk**

CHALK is an amazing library. You will be amazed to know that I use it in Microsoft for CLI apps too. I want you to play with it. Use it in your current app, use it in your assignment app.

You can use it in more apps later. I would also advise you to read more about writing CLI apps. These apps are used extensively in industry. Knowing it and creating some impressive projects down the line can boost your resume.

## **[ ] has the user beaten high score?**

challenge
You have a data structure created in ex15 which shows high score by players to the current user. Write a piece of function which will check this high score data structure and see if current user's score is a high score or not. if current user has made a high score then congratulate him/her and ask them to send screenshot so that you can update the high score data structure.

By using the same principles we learned in this class you can do it. We did this in exercise 12 where we were comparing superhero powers. This is somewhat similar.

Remember
You don't need to udpate the array there. Ask user to send a screenshot to you. You can then update it in the code itself.

We will learn about updating the database later.

- **Hint**

  - you need to access one entry at once
  - check whether the score is < less than or not
  - if not, then the user has broke records

- **Understanding**

  - looping to check for an entry in database/data structure

## **[ ] exercises**  
Not required to go for levelOne

Note: To go to levelOne you need to do all things mentioned in the point system.

There are two exercises which you can try to practice more programming.

a) leap year? b) prime number?

## **[x] learn markdown**

Markdown is a good skill to have. Essentially there are 4-5 things you need to know: headings, bullets, code, quote and that would be enough.

Search online and you'll get tons of tutorial on this. Learn this skill. It will be useful.

## **[x] hacktoberfest video**

During the hacktoberfest we showed how to open PRs on other repo. A repo which you don't own. This introduces concepts of cloning and forking which are extremely important when you want to contribute to someone else's repository.

This is not mandatory but I strongly suggest that you check it out. Hacktoberfest 2019 video.

## **[ ] explore repos**

Go to Github Trending and pick any repository. You don't need to understand the code. Observe

- Branch names
- Commit messages
- README file
- Open PRs
- Open issues
- Contributors
- Stars on the repositories
- This will help prime your brain with how to keep a nice   repository. If you like a repository star it. If you like a contributor, follow them.

## **[ ] explore git terminal**

While we did the entire thing in GUI to make it easy for beginners. In day to day life most devs use git in terminal. Don't get panicked, there's plenty of time to learn that.

You can explore the commands for what we just learned using this video I made last year.

## **[ ] idea for blogs**

If you want to write blogs on what you're learning please feel free to document your journey. You can also go a step further and do some investigative blogs

- Trending repos I explored
- What are the alternatives of Github?
- What is hacktoberfest and why you should care?
- What are some open source licenses and when to use them?
- Most used git commands.
- Some lesser known git commands.
- Let's understand git branching.
- Writing good commit messages.
- Write these blogs. And keep them ready for tomorrow's session.
